          This is a small demo project where I’m exploring WebAI concepts. I was
          genuinely mesmerized when I realized I could build AI-powered
          experiences using plain JavaScript. For a long time, I felt torn
          between AI and web development. I enjoyed both and could not quite
          choose a direction. Somehow, I do not know how, I had never heard of
          WebAI before. Thanks to

          and the people who organized DevFest Istanbul, I have discovered a new
          passion that brings these two worlds together. I chose a VR-like,
          first-person experience because the AI model was already available
          (MediaPipe), and I wanted to finally face something I had always
          avoided. 3D development always intimidated me, but at the same time, I
          have always loved websites that use it. This project is my way of
          stepping into that space.
